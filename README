# Usage: $ python polyAriboDclassifier-v2.py [-nG [--noGene]] inputFile.tsv outputFile
(if using mac do not use <input >output, use input output)


The algorithmCheck1.txt is the output from our current classifier (v2)

Comparing this to algorithmCheck1-Correct.txt, we can see that the error is 90.1% (14 wrong out of 146 samples)

These samples were taken from ckcc cohort from Liam's undergraduate research
